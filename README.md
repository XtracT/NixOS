> **Disclaimer**: This is a custom fork of [Sly-Harvey's NixOS Hyprland setup](https://github.com/Sly-Harvey/NixOS) optimized for **laptop users** focused on **battery life, productivity, and everyday computing** rather than gaming performance. I try to keep track of upstream changes and merge from time to time, while tailoring configurations to my personal needs and workflows.
